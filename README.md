# Fundamentals Of Programming Project
The project which I created in fundamentals of programming course in fall 2021 at Sharif University of Technology.
It's something like Twitter which name is Twiccer.

### How to use
First you should open **server.xcodeproj** and **client.xcodeproj** files with Xcode app. Then you have to change directories in **main.c** file in server folder based on your use and computer.
Then run server and after that, run client. And now, its use is as easy as possible, but I share with you its docs for better experience.

### Docs
There are two docs. First one is for client phase, and the second one is for server phase.  
- Please note there aren't retweet, user advanced search, tweet search and notification parts.
